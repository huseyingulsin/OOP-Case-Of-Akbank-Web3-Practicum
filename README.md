# OOP-Case-Of-Akbank-Web3-Practicum

It Ä±s coded for Akbank's web3 practicum. 

If you want to improve yourself in OOP(especially in js), this case is very efficient. 

## What are the instructions of the case?
1- You need to create a control system for vehicles that pass a  bridge. 

2- The system will collect some data which are hgs number, name-surname, branch of vehicle(1-car,2-minibus,3-bus), passing date, and balance.

3- You must create classes for every branch that we mentioned at 2.

4- You must create a counter class that includes a function to payment. The function can accept all vehicle branches and reduce the vehicle's balance.

5- The system must give a report that includes the daily vehicle list in an array.

6- And finally, you must create a class for managers which includes a function that shows the daily total earned.
